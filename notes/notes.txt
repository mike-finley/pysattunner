Notes: What has been researched to start doing minor tests?

10/18/15 Have put all the code onto ENG-1 PC to start looking at the code.

10/24/15 Starting to check out how the various pieces of code ".pysattunner.py", "devicemanager.py", "snmpquery.py",
 "configloader.py", "settings.py", "curl_json.sh", "start.sh", "nohup.out", and "README.md" are interconnected.
Appears that main code ".pysattunner.py" runs through "devicemanager.py" and "snmpquery.py".  Have to determine how
other code is called.

11/20/15 Found the "gitlab" machine and hooked it up to 10.21.18.200. I can ssh into this debian machine and see how
this machine was used to run tests.  Looked at the output of history, and found lots of commands and ways the code
was put together.

11/23/15 Have to start a basic tree of what code is called first.

12/03/15 Met with Adrian at their house.  He loaded up his laptop with all the code, I remoted into my PC that has
the code running and had networking to the devices.  We went through the main construct of the code, and started
to understand how the "uri" is formed, such as: "http://localhost:5000/queries/t1290_symbol_rate".  Also got some
understanding on how to start up the "pysattuner.py" program in a python virtual environment (virtualenv), and
see how the program puts out JSON script after a request is made. You have to use the "ps ux" command to show the
Used the "curl" command to put out requests to show the processes running with a grep command to kill the program
if needed.  Also noted that we had to do some "pip-install" commands to bring in "pysnmp" and "pytz".  There was
also a need to install mongodb, and also run it.  Used some "systemctl" commands as well to verify that mongodb
was running. While connected to the network, I couldn't get any values from the IPs that we were connecting to
via the configuration files.  Told Adrian that I would try locally to establish connections next time I was at
PACTV LA. 

12/14/15 Had been trying for about a week and a half to see why the "OID not found" was returned when trying to
connect to either the 1290, 1260, or XRF router.  Today I realized that the config files for the 1290 and 1260
were using the IP Address 10.21.18.111, which was the Dexing NDS3975 IRD in our PACTV LA MCR.  So I changed the
IP Address on the config file for the 1290 for the IP that is currently on the TAND-3 IRD (10.21.18.113).
Now it seems to be working.  I've issued the command "http://localhost:5000/queries/1290_symbol_rate", and seen
the value to be the same as what exists on TAND-3 IRD.  I changed the symbol rate manually on the TAND-3 IRD and
have seen the value change in the query response.
