#This shows some notes on how I've seen the relationship between most of the
#functions and iterations in the following files:

#Note that this will get explained from data flow representation.

#"pysattuner.py", 
#"devicemanager.py",
#"configloader.py", 
#"snmpquery.py", 
#"curbuild.tar.bz2", 
#"curl_json.sh",
#"settings.py", 
#"start.sh", 
#"dev_settings.py", 

#File: snmpquery.py hosts a function named "get_by_oid", 
#which is then used in the File: devicemanager.py in a function named "snmp_get",
#which is then used in the File: pysattuner.py in a function named "query_get_callback"
